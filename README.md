# belly-button-biodiversity
This assignment was to create a dashboard using Plotly describing data about bacteria in the human navel.

When the index.html loads, the code will retrieve the data and populate an initial set of charts based on the first test subject (id: 940).
* Demographic Information
* Bar Chart of Top Ten OTU IDs
* Gauge of Wash Frequency
* Bubble Chart of all OTU IDs

There is also a drop-down menu that is populated with all the test subject IDs. Selecting a new test subject ID causes the page to update all the charts to reflect the data from that specific test subject.
